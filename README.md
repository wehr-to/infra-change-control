# ðŸ”„ infra-change-control

This repository contains a **Change Management Toolkit** designed to simulate how modern infrastructure teams safely introduce, validate, and track infrastructure changes across environments.

It includes:

- Pre-flight validation scripts
- Rollback plans
- Annotated configuration changes
- Sample change advisory records (CARs)
- Change logging and audit frameworks

## ðŸŽ¯ Why This Repo Exists

Most outages aren't due to malicious actors â€” they're due to untested or undocumented changes.

This repo helps you:

- Practice **safe infrastructure modification**
- Create **audit trails and rollback workflows**
- Understand **change windows**, peer review, and staging
- Learn the language and processes of real-world operations
